# Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python and the Tkinter library for the GUI. The game can be played by two players taking turns to place X and O symbols on a 3x3 grid until one player manages to get three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or the grid is filled with symbols and no winner is declared.

## Installation
To run the game, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine, as well as the Tkinter library (which should be included with most Python installations). You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

## Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sk394/tictactoe_1.git
```
## Usage
To start the game, simply run the tic_tac_toe.py script from the command line:

## Copy code
> python tic_tac_toe.py

The game will open in a new window, and you can start playing by clicking on the buttons to place your symbols on the grid. The game will automatically switch between player turns and check for a winner after each move. You can restart the game at any time by clicking the "Restart" button.
